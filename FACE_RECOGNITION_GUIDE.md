# Face Recognition System Setup Guide

## Overview

The Face Recognition System allows you to:
- üîç **Recognize known people** in real-time using your camera
- ‚ûï **Register new people** with multiple face angles for better accuracy
- üéØ **Combine people counting with face recognition** for advanced tracking
- üìä **Track who enters your space** with detailed analytics

## Features

### 1. Live Face Recognition
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Works with all supported camera types (USB, IP, RTSP, Phone)
- Adjustable recognition tolerance
- Confidence scores for each recognition

### 2. Face Registration System
- **Multi-angle capture**: Front, left turn, right turn, up, down
- **Automatic face detection** with visual feedback
- **Data augmentation** for better recognition accuracy
- **Face database management** with easy deletion

### 3. Integrated Tracking
- **YOLO person detection** + **Face recognition**
- **Unique person counting** with face identification
- **Advanced analytics**: Who was recognized vs unknown
- **Session summaries** with detailed statistics

## Installation

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install face_recognition dlib scikit-learn joblib
```

### 2. System Requirements

#### Windows:
- Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio with C++ support
- CMake (for dlib compilation)

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install cmake
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev
```

### 3. Alternative Installation (if face_recognition fails)
If you encounter issues with `face_recognition`, try:
```bash
pip install --upgrade cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Your Camera
1. Edit your `.env` file to add camera sources
2. Test camera connection in the app
3. Ensure good lighting for face detection

### 2. Register People
1. Go to **Face Recognition System** ‚Üí **Register New Person**
2. Enter the person's full name
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to capture 5 photos:
   - Look straight at the camera
   - Turn head slightly left
   - Turn head slightly right
   - Look slightly up
   - Look slightly down
4. Click **Register Person** to save

### 3. Start Recognition
1. Choose **Live Face Recognition** or **Integrated Tracking**
2. Select your camera source
3. Adjust recognition tolerance (lower = stricter)
4. Click **Start Recognition**

## How It Works

### Face Registration Process
1. **Capture Multiple Angles**: 5 different face positions
2. **Face Detection**: Extract face regions from each photo
3. **Encoding Generation**: Create 128-dimension face encodings
4. **Data Augmentation**: Generate variations (brightness, contrast, blur, flip)
5. **Model Training**: Train SVM classifier for better accuracy
6. **Database Storage**: Save encodings and metadata

### Recognition Process
1. **YOLO Detection**: Detect people in the frame
2. **Face Extraction**: Extract face region from person bounding box
3. **Face Encoding**: Generate encoding for detected face
4. **Comparison**: Compare with known face database
5. **Classification**: Use SVM model for final identification
6. **Tracking Integration**: Link face identity with person tracking

### Data Storage
- **Face encodings**: `data/face_encodings.pkl`
- **Face database**: `data/face_database.json`
- **Face images**: `data/registered_faces/[person_id]/`
- **ML models**: `models/face_models/`

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results
1. **Good Lighting**: Ensure well-lit environment
2. **Clear Face View**: Face should be clearly visible (not obscured)
3. **Multiple Angles**: Register with different head positions
4. **Quality Photos**: Avoid blurry or low-resolution images
5. **Update Regularly**: Re-register if appearance changes significantly

### Recognition Settings
- **Tolerance 0.3-0.4**: Very strict (fewer false positives)
- **Tolerance 0.5-0.6**: Balanced (recommended)
- **Tolerance 0.7-0.8**: Lenient (more matches, but may have false positives)

### Camera Positioning
- **Height**: Camera at eye level or slightly above
- **Distance**: 2-8 feet from camera works best
- **Angle**: Face camera directly for best recognition
- **Stability**: Stable camera mount reduces false negatives

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Face Recognition Library Installation Error
```bash
# Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
# Then try:
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```

#### 2. No Faces Detected
- Check lighting conditions
- Ensure face is clearly visible
- Try moving closer to camera
- Verify camera is working

#### 3. Poor Recognition Accuracy
- Register more photos of the person
- Improve lighting during registration
- Lower the recognition tolerance
- Ensure face is not obscured

#### 4. Camera Not Working
- Check `.env` configuration
- Test camera in basic mode first
- Verify camera permissions
- Try different camera source

#### 5. Slow Performance
- Reduce camera resolution in `.env`
- Lower FPS setting
- Use USB camera instead of IP camera
- Close other applications using camera

### Error Messages

#### "face_recognition library not available"
- Install: `pip install face_recognition`
- Check system dependencies are installed

#### "Cannot access camera"
- Verify camera is not in use by another app
- Check camera permissions
- Try different camera index/URL

#### "No face detected during registration"
- Improve lighting
- Move closer to camera
- Ensure face is fully visible
- Try different camera angle
