# People Counting System using YOLO

## Project Overview

This project implements a people counting system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. It offers three different approaches:

1. Cumulative counting within a Region of Interest (ROI)
2. Real-time counting within an ROI
3. Full-frame counting with Streamlit deployment

## Why YOLO?

YOLO was chosen for this task due to its:
- Real-time processing capabilities
- High accuracy in object detection
- Flexibility in handling various environments and scenarios

## YOLO5 vs YOLO9

This project uses YOLO9, which offers improvements over YOLO5 including:
- Enhanced accuracy
- Better performance on small objects
- Improved speed-accuracy trade-off

For a detailed comparison, refer to the [Ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/de/models/yolov9/#supported-tasks-and-modes).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit interface:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Project Structure

The `models` folder contains three main scripts:

1. `modelv1.py`: Counts people only within the ROI area
2. `modelv2.py`: Counts people using ROI with cumulative tracking
3. `model_streamlit.py`: Deploys the model using Streamlit with batch processing for faster video processing
